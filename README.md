# liri-node-app

The liri node app is using several API's to more quickly find the questioned titles/names ect more effecently than going through the actual seperate databases.
You will retrieve the data that will power this app by sending requests using the axios package to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs. 


You'll use Axios to grab data from the OMDB API and the Bands In Town API


The "concert-this" portion is using the Bands in Town API through axios.
